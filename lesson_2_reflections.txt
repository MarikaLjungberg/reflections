What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a folder (.git) where the history of the files in the repository are
kept, so that you can view earlier verisons.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you 
think it offers?
It's some kind of middle ground. It might only exist on the hard drive (don't know yet), but it is 
connected to the Git repository. Adding something to the staging area might "connect" those files to
git, without having to commit them to the full project.
Also, if you have written many files, but only want to commit them to Git at a time, you can do this 
via the staging area.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Using the different diff methods, you can compare and see the differences between files
in the working directory, the staging area and the repository. You can use this to make
sure the changes you have made that you plan to commit really represent one logical change,
before you commit them. If not, you can "de-add" (what's the real name?) files from the
staging area, choosing only to commit the changes in those that do represent one logical change.
