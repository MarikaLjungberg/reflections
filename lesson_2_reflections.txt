What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a folder (.git) where the history of the files in the repository are
kept, so that you can view earlier verisons.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you 
think it offers?
It's some kind of middle ground. It might only exist on the hard drive (don't know yet), but it is 
connected to the Git repository. Adding something to the staging area might "connect" those files to
git, without having to commit them to the full project.
Also, if you have written many files, but only want to commit them to Git at a time, you can do this 
via the staging area.
