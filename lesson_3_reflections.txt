When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I'm working on several computers and wouldn't want to be dependant on all my files
being on only one computer that I would have to take with me.
Or when I want others to contribute to my projects, they would need a remote repository to
work through.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?
The changes you jave made in your code might conflict with the changes being made in the
remote "original" code.
