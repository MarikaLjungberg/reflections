When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I'm working on several computers and wouldn't want to be dependant on all my files
being on only one computer that I would have to take with me.
Or when I want others to contribute to my projects, they would need a remote repository to
work through.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?
The changes you jave made in your code might conflict with the changes being made in the
remote "original" code. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead
of another?
Forks are like cloning, but on GitHub's site, and are for when you want to use someone's 
repo and make your own changes to it, but you are not allowed to change the original code
and push to the forked repo. Clones are copies of a repo (forks bering a subset of clones?),
on GitHub or on your own computer. Branches are part of repositories, different versions of
the code that has been changed in different ways over time. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can keep track of when you last pulled the original code, where you left off the others,
and later compare and see what has changed since.
You would have a working version if something went wrong. You could always go back to an 
original version of the code and start off from there if you want to discard but not delete
your changes.
