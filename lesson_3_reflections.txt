When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I'm working on several computers and wouldn't want to be dependant on all my files
being on only one computer that I would have to take with me.
Or when I want others to contribute to my projects, they would need a remote repository to
work through.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?
The changes you jave made in your code might conflict with the changes being made in the
remote "original" code. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead
of another?
Forks are like cloning, but on GitHub's site, and are for when you want to use someone's 
repo and make your own changes to it, but you are not allowed to change the original code
and push to the forked repo. Clones are copies of a repo (forks bering a subset of clones?),
on GitHub or on your own computer. Branches are part of repositories, different versions of
the code that has been changed in different ways over time.
